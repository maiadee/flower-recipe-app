### Description 

For Project 2, I created a Floral Folio App, an app I would personally want and use. The app allows users to sign up and access their own bank of empty recipes, they can store flowers from our flower library in these recipes and add personalised notes. This feature lets users experiment with different colour and texture combinations before committing to purchases on a webshop, where your basket is timed. Additionally, users can contribute by adding new flowers to the library, updating existing entries, and adding notes to flower profiles for the benefit of other users.

### Timeframe

We were been given 1 week to work on this project individually

### Technologies used

Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongo Atlas, Mongoose, Postman, Netlify, Javascript, Trello

### Brief

We were asked to create a MEN Stack CRUD app using Node.js, Express and MongoDB. Our app must use EJS templates to render views to users and session-based authentication with full CRUD functionality.

- The app utilizes EJS Templates for rendering views to users.
- The app uses session-based authentication.
- The appâ€™s files are organized following the conventions taught in lectures.
- The app has at least one data entity in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The app has full CRUD functionality.
- Authorization is implemented in the app. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The app is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.
