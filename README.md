### Description 

For Project 2, I created a Floral Folio App, an app I would personally want and use. The app allows users to sign up and access their own bank of empty recipes, they can store flowers from our flower library in these recipes and add personalised notes. This feature lets users experiment with different colour and texture combinations before committing to purchases on a webshop, where your basket is timed. Additionally, users can contribute by adding new flowers to the library, updating existing entries, and adding notes to flower profiles for the benefit of other users.
